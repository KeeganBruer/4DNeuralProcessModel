# 4DNeuralProcessModel
The model is formatted to match: <br>


| Model | [x1,y1,z1,t1,x2,y2,z2,t2] => [distance] | 
| --------------- | ----------- |
| x1,y1,z1,t1 | Origin of the ray  |
| x2,y2,z2,t2 | The max point along the ray |
| distance    | The floating point percentage between the first and second points that the line intersects with an object |

# Neural Process Implementation Pulled From The Repository By [EmilienDupont](https://github.com/EmilienDupont/neural-processes)
The Neural Process has been adapted to use a custom decoder.
