# 4DNeuralProcessModel
The model is formatted to match: <br>
[x1, y1, z1, t1, x2, y2, z2, t2]=>[distance]

x1, y1, z1, t1 :The first point
x2, y2, z2, t2 :The second point
distance       :The floating point percentage between the first and second points that the line intersects with an object

<br>
max_d is the distance between the two points, <br>
d is the distance out from the first point towards 
the second.

# Neural Process Implementation Pulled From The Repository By [EmilienDupont](https://github.com/EmilienDupont/neural-processes)
The Neural Process has been adapted to use a custom decoder.
